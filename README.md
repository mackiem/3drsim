3D Reconstruction Simulator

3DRSim is a sandbox that allows you to load 3D models, and use projected structured light to create 3D reconstructions of those objects.

Right now, a single-shot colored structured light method based on a Debruijn sequence is implemented. This particular algorithm is based on the research by Zhang et al in 2002 [1]. The paper is available at [2].
